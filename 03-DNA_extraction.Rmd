**Objectives**

1. To learn about the most commonly used types of files for genome sequencing: FASTQ files
2. To understand the information included in FASTQ files
3. To identify good quality and bad quality reads from genome sequencing datasets

We use a DNA extraction kit (QIAGEN Genomic DNA kit) to obtain very high molecular weight genomic DNA. The protocol can be found [here](https://www.qiagen.com/br/resources/download.aspx?id=d2b85b26-16dd-4259-a3a7-a08cbd2a08a3&lang=en) or in our Canvas page.

## Protocol using G/20 QIAGEN columns

1. Label your preps and make sure that the Buffer QF is prewarmed to 50°C and that the centrifuge is set at 4°C.

2. For each prep, add 2 μl, of RNase A solution (100 mg/ml) to a 1 ml aliquot of Buffer B1.

3. Dissolve lysozyme in distilled water to a concentration of 100 mg/ml.

4. Pellet bacteria from an appropriate volume of culture by centrifugation at 3000-5000 x g for 5-10 min. Discard the

5. Resuspend the bacteria pellet from step 3 in 1 ml of Buffer B1 (with RNase A) by vortexing at top speed.

6. Add the RNase A to Buffer B1 according to step 2 before adding the buffer to the bacteria.

7. Resuspend the bacterial pellet as thoroughly as possible by vortexing. For efficient lysis of the bacteria, it is important to have a homogeneous suspension.

5. Add 20 μl of lysozyme stock solution (100 mg/ml), and 45 μl of Proteinase K stock solution. Incubate at 37°C for
at least 30 min.

6. Add 350 μl of Buffer B2, and mix by inverting the tube several times or by vortexing for a few seconds.

7. Incubate at 50°C for 30 min. Mix the lysate and Buffer B2 very thoroughly. This step is important for efficient deproteinization.

8. Equilibrate a QIAGEN Genomic-tip with 1 ml of Buffer QBT and allow the QIAGEN Genomic-tip to empty by gravity flow.

9. Allow the QIAGEN Genomic-tip to drain completely. The flow of buffer will stop when the meniscus reaches the upper frit. The frit prevents the QIAGEN Genomic-tip from running dry, allowing it to be left unattended. Do not force out the remaining buffer, as this will necessitate restarting the flow with a syringe and adapter.

10.  Vortex the lysed sample for 10 s at maximum speed and apply it to the equilibrated QIAGEN Genomic-tip. Allow it to enter the resin by gravity flow.

11. Wash the QIAGEN Genomic-tip with 3 x 1 ml of Buffer QC. Allow Buffer QC to move through the QIAGEN Genomic-tip by gravity flow. Two washes are sufficient to remove all contaminants in the majority of DNA preparations.

12. Elute the genomic DNA with 2 x 1 ml, of Buffer QF. Place the QIAGEN Genomic-tip over a clean 5 ml collection tube.  Allow the QIAGEN Genomic-tip to drain by gravity flow.

13. Precipitate the DNA by adding 1.4 ml (0.7 volumes) room-temperature (15 25°C) isopropanol to the eluted DNA. 

14. Mix and centrifuge immediately at 15000 x g for at least 15 min at 4°C. Carefully remove the supernatant. Proceed with
step 6B.

15. Wash the centrifuged DNA pellet with 1 ml of cold 70% ethanol. Vortex briefly and centrifuge at 15000 x g for 10 min at 4°C. Carefully remove the supernatant without disturbing the pellet. 

16. Air-dry for 5 10 min, and re-suspend the DNA in 1 ml of a suitable buffer (e.g., TE buffer, pH 8.0, or 10 mM Tris·Cl, pH
8.5). 

17. Dissolve the DNA at 55°C for 1-2 h

## Quantification of DNA using Qubit and Nanodrop

To determine how much DNA we extracted, we will use Qubit and Nanodrop to quantify the amount extracted.

## Analytical gel for DNA integrity and size

1. Mix 0.3 g of agarose into 60 ml of 1x TAE buffer

2. Heat the mixture in the microwave for 30s in 5s intervals until the solution is clear. Mix at every interval.

3. Wait for the mix to cool a little and add 5 μl of SYBR SAFE/SYBR GREEN to the mix

4. Add the mixture to the gel box with the comb in it. **Ask your TA/PLA/Professor for help!**

5. Wait 20/30 mins for the gel to solidify.

6. Add 10 μl of DNA ladder 1kb in the first and last wells of the gel

7. Mix 3 μl of the sample with 6μl of DNA loading buffer and load the mix into one of the wells in the gel. 

8. Run the gel for 30 minutes at 95 volts.

9. Visualize the gel in the blue light machine, tak

10. Take a picture for your electronic notebook.

## DNA extraction report

```{block, type='rmdquestion'}

In an R markdown file, include the 260/230 values, 260/280 values, the concentration from the nanodrop and the concentration from the Qubit.

Also include your gel and indicate your DNA size.

Discuss your results, answer these questions and add them to that discussion:

- Is the Nanodrop concentration higher than the Qubit? Why? 
- Would you consider your DNA extraction to be of HMW? 
- Did you extract enough DNA for the Nanopore sequencing of your genome?
