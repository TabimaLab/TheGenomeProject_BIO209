> 3. Based on the Read Length Histogram Basecalled Bases figure, what was your N50?

> 4. Based on your Read Length Histogram Basecalled Bases, what was the length of the longest read you sequenced?

> 5. Based on the Mux Scan Grouped figure, what was the maximum number of Active pores (green bars) in your run? What time?
